## üéØ **INTERVIEW PREPARATION**

### **Common Questions & Answers:**

#### **"Walk me through this project"**
*"I built a comprehensive infrastructure monitoring system that demonstrates my systems engineering expertise. The system uses Prometheus for metrics collection, Grafana for visualization, and includes custom Python automation for intelligent health scoring. Everything is containerized for easy deployment and scaling."*

#### **"What challenges did you face?"**
*"The main challenge was integrating multiple monitoring technologies while maintaining data consistency and performance. I solved this by designing a modular architecture where each component has clear responsibilities and well-defined interfaces."*

#### **"How would you scale this system?"**
*"For scaling, I'd implement Kubernetes deployment, add horizontal pod autoscaling, implement distributed storage for Prometheus, and create automated service discovery for dynamic environments."*

#### **"What monitoring philosophy do you follow?"**
*"I believe in monitoring what matters - focusing on business-critical metrics, implementing intelligent alerting to reduce noise, and providing actionable insights that enable proactive incident prevention rather than reactive troubleshooting."*

### **Technical Deep Dive Questions:**

#### **"Explain your Python health scoring algorithm"**
*"The algorithm evaluates multiple system dimensions - CPU load, memory utilization, disk space, and network connectivity. It uses weighted scoring based on criticality, with configurable thresholds for different severity levels. The output is a 0-100 score that provides instant health visibility."*

#### **"How do you handle data retention and storage?"**
*"Prometheus handles time-series data with configurable retention policies. I've set up efficient storage with compression and implemented data lifecycle management to balance storage costs with historical analysis needs."*

#### **"What's your alerting strategy?"**
*"I implement a three-tier alerting system: immediate alerts for critical issues, warning alerts for trending problems, and informational alerts for capacity planning. Each alert includes context and suggested remediation steps."*
