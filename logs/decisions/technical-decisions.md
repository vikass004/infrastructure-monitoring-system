## Decision Log

### Decision #001: Project Architecture
**Date**: September 12, 2025  
**Decision**: Microservices architecture with containerized components  

**Context**: 
Need to create a scalable monitoring system that can be deployed across different environments.

**Options Considered**:
1. Monolithic application with embedded monitoring
2. Microservices with separate monitoring components
3. Cloud-native serverless approach

**Decision**: Option 2 - Microservices architecture

**Rationale**:
- Better separation of concerns
- Individual component scaling
- Easier maintenance and updates
- Industry standard approach
- Matches job requirements for containerization

**Impact**:
- Increased initial complexity
- Better long-term maintainability
- Easier to demonstrate different technologies

### Decision #002: Monitoring Stack Technology
**Date**: September 12, 2025  
**Decision**: Prometheus + Grafana + Alertmanager stack  

**Context**: 
Need to choose monitoring technologies that align with industry standards and job requirements.

**Options Considered**:
1. Prometheus + Grafana + Alertmanager
2. ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana)
3. Datadog or other commercial solutions
4. Custom monitoring solution

**Decision**: Option 1 - Prometheus stack

**Rationale**:
- Industry standard for metrics monitoring
- Open source and widely adopted
- Strong community and documentation
- Integrates well with containerized environments
- Matches systems engineer skill requirements
- Cost-effective for demonstration purposes

**Impact**:
- Standardized metrics collection
- Rich visualization capabilities
- Flexible alerting system
- Industry-relevant skills demonstration

### Decision #003: Automation Language
**Date**: September 12, 2025  
**Decision**: Python for all automation scripts  

**Context**: 
Job description specifically mentions Python scripting as a required skill.

**Options Considered**:
1. Python
2. Bash/PowerShell scripts
3. Go
4. Mix of languages

**Decision**: Option 1 - Python exclusively

**Rationale**:
- Explicitly mentioned in job requirements
- Rich ecosystem for infrastructure automation
- Better error handling than shell scripts
- Good libraries for monitoring integrations
- Readable and maintainable code

### Decision #004: Documentation Strategy
**Date**: September 12, 2025  
**Decision**: Markdown-based documentation with daily logging  

**Context**: 
Need comprehensive documentation for portfolio and job interview demonstration.

**Options Considered**:
1. Markdown files in repository
2. Wiki-based documentation
3. Automated documentation generation
4. Video documentation

**Decision**: Option 1 - Markdown in repository

**Rationale**:
- Version controlled with code
- Easy to read and write
- Portable across platforms
- Integrates with Git workflows
- Industry standard for technical documentation
- Easy to convert to other formats

**Impact**:
- Documentation stays synchronized with code
- Easy collaboration and review
- Portable knowledge base
- Professional presentation

### Decision #005: Development Logging Approach
**Date**: September 12, 2025  
**Decision**: Detailed daily logs with implementation tracking  

**Context**: 
User specifically requested ability to track daily coding progress and implementation details.

**Options Considered**:
1. Simple commit messages
2. Daily markdown logs
3. Time tracking tools
4. Detailed implementation logs

**Decision**: Option 2 & 4 - Daily logs with implementation tracking

**Rationale**:
- Demonstrates systematic approach
- Valuable for portfolio presentation
- Shows problem-solving process
- Useful for project retrospectives
- Aligns with documentation requirements in job description

**Impact**:
- Additional overhead but valuable output
- Clear demonstration of development process
- Better project management
- Enhanced learning and reflection

### Decision #006: Containerization Strategy
**Date**: September 12, 2025  
**Decision**: Docker Compose for local development, individual containers for production  

**Context**: 
Need containerization strategy that supports both development and production scenarios.

**Options Considered**:
1. Docker Compose only
2. Kubernetes from start
3. Individual Docker containers
4. No containerization

**Decision**: Option 1 with path to Option 3

**Rationale**:
- Docker Compose simplifies local development
- Easy to transition to orchestration later
- Demonstrates containerization skills
- Matches modern infrastructure practices
- Easier for portfolio demonstration

**Impact**:
- Faster development setup
- Portable deployment
- Industry-relevant skills
- Easy scaling path
